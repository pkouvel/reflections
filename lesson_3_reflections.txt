When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It would be quite necessary when collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because pulling automatically the changes from the remote repository might
negatively affect the work being done locally.
