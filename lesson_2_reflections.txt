What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The hidden .git folder where git metadata will be saved is being created.
Initialization is needed because otherwise Git will not be following the changes
in the different files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The Git directory or repository is where Git stores the metadata and object
database of a project. The working directory is a single checkout of one version
of the project. The staging area is a file that stores information about what
will go into the next commit. The staging area can help with splitting up a large
change into multiple commits and it can also help with reviewing changes.
