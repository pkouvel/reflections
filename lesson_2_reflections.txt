What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The hidden .git folder where git metadata will be saved is being created.
Initialization is needed because otherwise Git will not be following the changes
in the different files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The Git directory or repository is where Git stores the metadata and object
database of a project. The working directory is a single checkout of one version
of the project. The staging area is a file that stores information about what
will go into the next commit. The staging area can help with splitting up a large
change into multiple commits and it can also help with reviewing changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
By breaking up a large change into multiple smaller commits.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be helpful is situations where one wants to try making changes to
a project that they don't want to introduce directly on the working version of
the project. Branches make it easier to read the history of commits because they
are human-readable labels.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It looks like a binary tree with leaves and one root which makes it very familiar
as a concept.
